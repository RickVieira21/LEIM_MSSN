This project, developed in Java for the Final Project for the Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems course, simulates an ecosystem inhabited by different species. 
The application allows users to observe the interactions between species and the ongoing evolution of the ecosystem over time. 
This simulation provides insights into natural processes and models various dynamics within a virtual environment.
